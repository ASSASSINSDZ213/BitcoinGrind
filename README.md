BitcoinGrind
============

This is a bitcoin faucet rotator.
More info on Bitcoin:

This rotator completely runs off of javascript and includes several features such as jumping, linking, reloading, and auto-fill-in's, in addition to previous and next page buttons.

You can easily add/remove faucets by modifying the cases inside the switch() statement. Follow the same syntax, make sure the numbers count up consecutively, and don't forget to change variable c to equal the highest case number.

Just embed the javascript file into your html webpage and add the corresponding button to utilize it. All it does is switch the src of the iframe with an id="fm" attribute.
